# Employee Management System

This is a desktop-based Employee Management System developed in **Java** using **Swing** for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and **JDBC** for database connectivity. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee records, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **GUI Interface**: A user-friendly and intuitive desktop application built with Java Swing.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes JDBC to connect with a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) to store and retrieve employee data.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform full **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete operations on employee records.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific employees based on their ID or other criteria.
- **Data Persistence**: All employee information is securely stored in a database, ensuring data is persistent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **Java Swing**: Used for building the desktop GUI components.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: The standard API for database communication.
- **SQL Database**: A relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or others.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later**
- An **SQL database** (e.g., MySQL)
- The **JDBC driver** for your specific database (e.g., `mysql-connector-java.jar`).

### Instructions

1.  **Set up the Database**:
    - Create a database and a table for employees.
    - An example SQL script for a `employees` table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE employees (
          id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
          name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
          department VARCHAR(255),
          salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
      );
      ```

2.  **Configure the Project**:
    - Place the **JDBC driver JAR file** in your project's `lib` directory or add it to your project's build path.
    - Update the **database connection details** (URL, username, password) in the `DatabaseManager.java` (or similar) class.

3.  **Run the Application**:
    - Compile and run the main class (e.g., `Main.java` or `EmployeeApp.java`) from your IDE (like NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA).
